# ProteomePersonalizer

ProteomePersonalizer is the first soup-to-nuts solution for contemporary proteogenomics, building upon the conceptual framework of its predecessor, ProteomeGenerator. It is a computational suite that, via comprehensive integration of genome sequencing and RNA-seq data (starting with raw FASTQ or BAM files), captures a diverse breadth of sequencing variation, structural variation, and aberrant epi/genetic events in order to generate a complete and maximally accurate, personalized protein sequence database (in FASTA format) that can be used in LC/MS proteomics searches, among other things. In addition to accounting for such (germline and somatic) events as SNPs, indels, de novo splice junctions & transcripts, and gene fusions, ProteomePersonalizer also (optionally) handles potentially massive somatic allele heterogenicity (anticipated in, for instance, cancer genomes) by minimally expanding the output database to include all plausible peptide sequences surrounding heterogeneous loci. Furthermore, PG2 is effectively plug-n-play, only requiring installation of the common Python package manager Anaconda, Python-based pipeline manager Snakemake, and (optionally) the container/virtualization software Singularity. Finally, ProteomePersonalizer (via Snakemake) fully integrates task scheduling managers (such as LSF) for deployment to high performance clusters. It runs entirely on Linux-based systems.
